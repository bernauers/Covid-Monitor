# Covid-19 Monitor

This porject was inspired by a reddit post by user u/andheroe12 (https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/id6dq7/i_wrote_a_script_to_monitor_covid_cases_in_a/)

I used this project to become familiar with Twilio and Seemless Cloud. Learning how to interact with an API and grab information from it. (Seemless Cloud Guide: https://app.seamlesscloud.io/guide)

Much of the code was written by: u/andheroe12. I find that rewritting something is more beneficial to me then forking the repository or a simple copy paste.
